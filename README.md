# Ender 5 S1 Modpack

This is a curated repository of mods I created for the Ender 5 S1. Some of them are generic though and can be adapted to more printers. Those for the Ender 5 S1 are designed specific for use with the body enclosure and top enclosure, but can be used without as well. STL and 3MF files, CAD models as well as BOM tables and detailed build instructions included.

## Mods

1. [Lighting](./Lighting/v1/README.md) (generic for all 20x20 mm aluminum profiles)
